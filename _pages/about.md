Hello! I'm an aspiring robotics researcher interested in **multi-agent systems** and **harsh-environment robotics**. I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant with the [Controls, Robotics and Automation Lab (CoRAL)](https://sites.google.com/view/osu-coral/home") at Oklahoma State University. My research involves autonomous ground vehicles, spatiotemporal wind simulation, and wind-aware human-machine interfaces.

Currently a third year undergraduate studying **Electrical and Computer Engineering** with honors. Pursuing minors in mathematics and Spanish. Also involved in the NASA Micro-g extracurricular design competition and am Vice President of Mercury Robotics at OSU.
