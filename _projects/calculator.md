# Project Overview

Exploration of terminal-based user input and command-line instructions.

Objectives:

* Infix calculator support. Use parenthesis for all expressions - implementing PEMDAS out of project scope.
* Postfix calculator support.
* Intuitive and robust error-handling for CLI.
* Support common functions - primitive operations, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, variable declarations, negation, etc.
