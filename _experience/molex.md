# Automated Testing, Data Gathering, Graphing
I served as a Software and Electrical Engineering Co-op for [Molex](https://www.molex.com/molex/home) from January to August of 2021. I worked virtually for several months where I developed automated testing software and modular data collection and real-time graphing libraries. The objective was to accelerate production of testing and analysis GUIs; my software was already being tested internationally for a variety of projects upon my departure and there were plans to further expand its functionality. I taught myself C#, .NET, and Windows Forms for the role.

# Automotive Electromagnetic Compatability Testing
I also gained experience with hardware electronics while visiting Molex's Lisle, IL facility for several weeks. I performed worst-case circuit analysis on an automotive USB power-delivery device. While there I completed simulation and hardware EMC testing and debugging on said USB device to ensure compliance to industry and customer standards.
